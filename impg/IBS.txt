We will use impg function as scaffold for detecting IBS (identity-by-state) segments. We define an IBS as a chunck for which the similarity value is 1 (the cutoff must be a parameter).

Then, the function will take as an input:
  -agc data.
  -paf data.
  -chr number
  -chunk size.
  -similarity cutoff, 1 as default.
  -sequences name

What the ibs function needs to do is iterate the impg in chunks across the whole chromosome, and clean the ouput, only preserving the similarity = 1 of the pairwise sequence analyzed. Then it has to combine chunks which are consecutive and have identity = 1.
